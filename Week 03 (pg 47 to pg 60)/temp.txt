1. An organization contains 5 departments, and each department contains (9, 12, 14, 16, 21) faculty members in which there will be one Professor and two Associate Professors. Develop a java method to calculate total Assistant Professors present in the entire organization.
2. Implement the following leetcode program using method overloading. You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

3. Enhance a Utility class from session no 7 by adding three more static methods. which overload existing Sort () which accepts an array of double to sort them, findSmallest () which accepts an array of double to find smallest value, findLargest () which accepts an array of double to find largest value Access overloading methods from main () of Demo class of different package. (Take input through command line.)
4. Create a class GeometricShape with three overloaded methods findArea () to find area of square, rectangle, and circle, and modularize at method, class, and package level. (Hint: To find area of a square pass an integer value and to find a circle pass a double value)
5. Create a class GeometricShape with three overloaded methods findPerimeter () to find perimeter of square, rectangle, and circle. and modularize at method, class, and package level.

Note: To find perimeter of a square pass an integer value and to find a circle pass a double value
6. Enhance the class Palindrome of Problem W02-P04 with another static method isPalindrome() to check whether an each element array is palindrome or not. If all the elements in the array are palindrome numbers then return true otherwise, return false. Access them using main () from the same class. (Take hard coded value for the variable n)
